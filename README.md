## How I started
Me being the computer loving person I am, always thought the next step was to start programming, so I started off in C#, then proceeded to learn HTML, CSS, and Javascript for web development then Python for backend (Python is also just really fun to play around with), then learned C to start operating system development, I don't normally host big projects on GitHub but when I do they're usually public so everyone can use it as a reference or template (most of my repos are private because it's just be being stupid).

## What I'm doing now

Don't have much of a project at the moment besides my CLI which you'll be able to find in my repo list

## What I create

Depends, I create alot of things, but I've always been fascinated with kernels and operating systems and major software devolopment, so I usually create small kernels and very basic operating systems for the time being, I also really love computer viruses I love creating them too
